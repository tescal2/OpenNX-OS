<b>DevOps. Programmability. Automation.</b> 
These concepts have become a central and pervasive theme in many areas of information technology. What does it all mean to the world of network infrastructure? 

Automated workflows and virtualization technologies have led to dramatic improvements in data center scale, agility, and efficiency. Application developers, server administrators, and Cloud and DevOps teams have been utilizing the processes and tools around automation for many years, resulting in streamlined and less error prone workflows. These teams are able to keep up with the speed of business requirements and market transitions due to modern workflows. Leveraging open development frameworks has been essential for innovation. 

Why not leverage these concepts for the network, whose management methods are still dominated by human-to-machine- interfaces? 

Enter Open NX-OS on the Cisco Nexus platform, a rich software suite built on Linux foundation that exposes application programmatic interfaces (APIs), data models, and programmatic constructs. Using APIs and configuration agents, operators can affect configuration changes in a more programmatic way. 

This book explores Open NX-OS and many of the tools and options it provides. The chapters below examine the drivers for network automation, the fundamental supporting technologies, and the many new capabilities now available to network infrastructures. Real-world use cases are provided that can be immediately utilized for a successful transition to more efficient, safer, repeatable operations.
